# **Character-Level Language Models Repo üï∫üèΩ**

This repository contains multiple character-level language models (charLLM). Each language model is designed to generate text at the character level, providing a granular level of control and flexibility.


## üåü Available Language Models 

- **Character-Level MLP LLM (<i>First MLP LLM</i>)**
- **GPT-2 (under process)**

## Character-Level MLP

The Character-Level MLP language model is implemented based on the approach described in the paper "[A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)" by Bential et al. (2002). 
It utilizes a multilayer perceptron architecture to generate text at the character level.

## Installation

### With PIP

This repository is tested on Python 3.8+, and PyTorch 2.0.0+.

First, create a **virtual environment** with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.

Then, you will need to install **PyTorch**.

When backends has been installed, CharLLMs can be installed using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install charLLM
```
### With GIT 

CharLLMs can be installed using conda as follows:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/RAravindDS/Neural-Probabilistic-Language-Model.git
```


### Quick Tour


To use the Character-Level MLP language model, follow these steps:

1. Install the package dependencies.
2. Import the `CharMLP` class from the `charLLM` module.
3. Create an instance of the `CharMLP` class.
4. Train the model on a suitable dataset.
5. Generate text using the trained model.

Feel free to explore the repository and experiment with the different language models provided.
