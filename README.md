# Character-Level Language Models Repository

This repository contains multiple character-level language models (charLLM). Each language model is designed to generate text at the character level, providing a granular level of control and flexibility.

## Available Language Models

- Character-Level MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
- GPT-2 (under-process)

## Character-Level MLP

The Character-Level MLP language model is implemented based on the approach described in the paper "[A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)" by Bential et al. (2002). 
It utilizes a multilayer perceptron architecture to generate text at the character level.

### Usage

To use the Character-Level MLP language model, follow these steps:

1. Install the package dependencies.
2. Import the `CharMLP` class from the `charLLM` module.
3. Create an instance of the `CharMLP` class.
4. Train the model on a suitable dataset.
5. Generate text using the trained model.

Feel free to explore the repository and experiment with the different language models provided.
